2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-1#1 Warning
Clock Net has non-BUF driver and too many loads  
Clock net system_i/processing_system7_0/inst/FCLK_CLK0 is not driven by a Clock Buffer and has more than 512 loads. Driver(s): system_i/processing_system7_0/inst/PS7_i/FCLKCLK[0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.346 ns between system_i/VGA_CONTROLLER_0/U0/VGA_CONTROLLER_v1_0_CONTROLLER_AXI_inst/slv_reg0_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and system_i/VGA_CONTROLLER_0/U0/VGA_CONTROLLER_v1_0_CONTROLLER_AXI_inst/controller_vga/flagneghsync_reg/D (clocked by clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.798 ns between system_i/VGA_CONTROLLER_0/U0/VGA_CONTROLLER_v1_0_CONTROLLER_AXI_inst/slv_reg0_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and system_i/VGA_CONTROLLER_0/U0/VGA_CONTROLLER_v1_0_CONTROLLER_AXI_inst/controller_vga/flagnegvsync_reg/D (clocked by clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
